Abstract
The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor- c(ERRc) is a constitutively active transcription factor regulating
genes involved in several important cellular processes, including hepatic glucose metabolism, alcohol metabolism, and the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. cAMP responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH) is an ER-bound bZIPfamily transcription factor that is activated upon ER stress and regulates genes encoding acute-phase proteins whose
expression is increased in response to inflammation. Here, we report that ERR cdirectly regulates CREBH gene expression in
response to ER stress. ERR cbound to the ERR cresponse element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERR cby
adenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown ofERRcor inhibition of ERR cby ERR cspecific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of
CREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1 awas required for ERR cmediated induction of the CREBH gene as
demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERR cand PGC1 aon the CREBH
promoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERR cand PGC1 abinding site.
Moreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese condition significantly increased CRP gene
expression, and this increase was significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear receptor
ERRcdirectly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.

Introduction
Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are members of the NR3B
subfamily of nuclear receptors which include ERR a, ERR b, and
ERR c. These orphan nuclear receptors regulate transcription via
ERREs but do not bind endogenous estrogen [1]. The ERRs are
named due to the conservation in the structure of their DNA-
binding domains/DBDs with the highly homologous EstrogenReceptor [2]. Crystallographic studies indicate that the ERRsalong with ERR care constitutively active without a natural
ligand, while several synthetic ligands either stimulate or repressthe activity of ERR cby promoting or disrupting ERR–coactivator
interactions [3]. Among them GSK5182, a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen
analogue, is a selective inverse agonist of ERR cand directly binds
to the ligand binding domain and inhibits transactivation byERR c[4–8]. ERR cis primarily expressed in heart, brain, kidney,
pancreas and liver tissues [3]. We previously reported that hepaticERR cregulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by directly binding to the
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) promoters along with coactivator PGC-1 a[5]. Previous results from our laboratory also demonstrated that
ERR cdirectly binds to the LIPIN1 promoter along with
coactivator PGC-1 ato regulate LIPIN1 gene expression, and
inhibits hepatic insulin signaling [6]. ERR calso controls hepatic
CB1 receptor-mediated CYP2E1 expression at the transcriptionallevel and thus contributes to the oxidative liver injury by alcohol[7]. Finally, hypoxia induces PDK4 gene expression throughinduction of ERR c[8]. The transcriptional activity of the ERR
family is dependent on interactions with coactivators, in particularPGC-1 aand PGC-1 b[9]. ERR aand ERR cregulate mitochon-
drial programs involved in oxidative phosphorylation and anuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinatesthe postnatal metabolic transition in the heart [9]. Though allthese reports clearly suggest a key role of ERR cin different
cellular processes, its role in ER stress is yet to be determined.
ER stress is a state associated with perturbation of ER
homeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteinsin the ER [10]. CREBH, an ER-stress-activated liver enrichedtranscription factor, has been previously reported to transcrip-

to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokinesinterleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a(TNF a) [11].
Recently, CREBH has been demonstrated to play a critical role inER-stress-mediated regulation of iron metabolism via induction ofhepcidin (Hamp) gene expression, in triglyceride metabolism andhepatic lipogenesis, and in the mediation of the hormonalregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under fasting or insulin-resistant conditions [12–15], thereby underlining the importanceof CREBH in various hepatic metabolic pathways. Recent studiesfrom our group have demonstrated that activation of Cb1r leads tophosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signalingpathway which in turn activates CREBH. This Cb1r-JNK-CREBH pathway was further demonstrated to regulate hepaticgluconeogenesis by regulating key gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK,and G6Pase) and lipid metabolism by regulating Lipin1 [16–17].Our group has also reported that hepatic cannabinoid receptortype 1 mediates alcohol-induced regulation of bile acid enzymegenes (CYP7A1, and CYP27A1) expression via CREBH [18].
PGC-1 a, a member of a small family of coactivators, was
identified using yeast two hybrid assays for PPAR c-interacting
proteins [19] and is implicated in mitochondrial metabolism,thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, adipocyte differentia-tion, gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake [20–21]. PGC-1 atargets
promoters by interacting directly with numerous DNA bindingtranscription factors and then coordinating several biochemicalevents, including recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymessuch as p300/CBP and SRC-1, interaction with the basaltranscription machinery and linking of transcription to RNA
splicing [22].
C-reactive protein (CRP) in comparison to other inflammation
markers is a relatively stable, robust and an exquisitely sensitive
serum protein. In some studies, CRP level in plasma predicts
cardiovascular events even better than low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level [23]. Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic
studies have shown that CRP is not just a marker but rather an
active mediator for endothelial dysfunction, arterial thrombosis
and atherogenesis [24–25]. CRP, as an inflammatory cytokine, is
primarily synthesized in liver and regulated in response to
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 b(IL-1 b) [26–28]. Hepato-
cytes are believed to be the major contributor of circulating CRP
in plasma. Therefore, hepatic CRP is able to cause liver per se
damage and inflammation, and plays a key role in the
development of atherosclerosis when entering into the blood
circulation. In hepatoma cell lines, the endogenous CRP gene is
either dysregulated or weakly active [29]. However, plasma levels
of CRP may rise rapidly and markedly ( .1000 fold) after an acute
inflammation in human [30].
Here, we examined the mechanism of how nuclear receptor,
ERR cregulates ER bound bZIP transcription factor, CREBH
under the conditions of ER stress. Upon ER stress, expression of
both transcription factors increases significantly. ERR cdirectly
binds to the CREBH promoter. Of interest, PGC1 aacts as a
coactivator for ERR c. We observed a significant increase in
histone H3 and H4 acetylation in CREBH promoters upon
induction of ER stress by tunicamycin (Tm) treatment. Knock-
down of ERR csignificantly decreases the expression of CREBH

ERRcInduces CREBH Gene Expression
Previous reports suggest various nuclear receptors and tran-
scription factors cross talk to regulate the mammalian ER stressresponse [35–36]. In addition, the nuclear receptors GR, PPAR a,
and HNF4 aregulate transcription of the ER bound transcription
factor CREBH [15,36–37]. We demonstrated previously thatERR cregulates ATF6 ain response to ER stress [38]. To
investigate whether ERR cregulates CREBH, which belongs to
the same CREB3 family as ATF6 and is structurally related to it,ERR cwas overexpressed by Ad-ERR cin AML12 cells. Interest-
ingly, CREBH mRNA level, as determined by qPCR, increasedmore than six-fold after ERR coverexpression (Fig. 1A). CREBH
protein level, as determined by Western blot, also increased underthe same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Next, to checkwhether CREBH gene induction was ERR cspecific, ERR awas
overexpressed in AML12 cells by adenovirus. No significantchange in CREBH protein level was observed after ERR a
overexpression, suggesting that CREBH gene induction is ERR c
specific (Fig. 1C). To verify these in vitro results, mice were infected
with Ad-ERR cby tail vein injection. Consistent with the in vitro
results, an almost fivefold increase in CREBH mRNA level wasobserved. A significant increase in CREBH-N (active form) proteinlevel was also observed in vivo (Fig. 1D and 1E). As observed in the
mouse cell lines, we noticed a similar effect of ERR coverexpres-
sion in HepG2 cells. ERR coverexpression significantly increased
CREBH mRNA, and protein levels (Fig. 1F and G), indicating

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086342.g004Regulation of CREBH by ERR c
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342that ERR c-mediated induction of the CREBH gene is conserved
in humans and in mouse hepatoma cell lines. Collectively theseresults demonstrate that ERR cpositively regulates CREBH gene
expression.
ER Stress Induces CREBH Gene Expression via ERR c
Next, we ascertained the molecular mechanism of ERR c-
mediated CREBH gene induction. A transient transfection assaywas performed with the ERR cexpression vector and the mouse
and human CREBH promoter- driven luciferase reporter gene(Fig. 2A, and B). ERR csignificantly enhanced both mouse and
human CREBH promoter activity. It was reported previously thattunicamycin (Tm) induces CREBH and ERR cgene expression
[11,38]. To investigate whether Tm mediated activation of theCREBH promoter depends on ERR c, a transient transfection
assay was performed with the mouse CREBH promoter-drivenluciferase reporter gene. Tm treatment significantly increasedCREBH promoter activity but activation was severely compro-
mised when endogenous ERR cwas knocked down (Fig. 2C).
Next, AML12 cells were treated with Tm or infected with Ad-shERR cto knockdown endogenous ERR cto observe the effect of
ERR cknockdown on CREBH gene expression. As expected,knockdown of endogenous ERR csignificantly suppressed the Tm-
mediated increase in CREBH mRNA level (Fig. 2D). Next, we
performed Western blot analyses to check the CREBH-N protein
level under the same experimental conditions. In agreement with
the mRNA level, CREBH-N protein level also decreased
significantly in response to Ad-shERR cinfection (Fig. 2E) in
AML12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
ERR cmediates the induction of CREBH gene expression by ER
stress.
ERRcActivates CREBH Gene Promoter via an ERRE
PGC1 aacts as an ERR ccoactivator [6]. To test whether
PGC1 aand ERR ctogether play any role in the induction of
CREBH, transient transfection assays were performed with the
mouse CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene and
ERR cand PGC1 aexpression vectors. ERR csignificantly
increased CREBH promoter activity, and this activity was further
augmented in the presence of PGC1 a(Fig. 3A). A series of
deletion constructs was analyzed to identify the DNA sequence
conferring the ERR c-mediated ER stress effect on the CREBH
promoter. Deletion of the CREBH promoter sequence from
0.2 kb to 0.1 kb drastically decreased the promoter activity
conferred by ERR c, suggesting that the region from 0.2 kb to
0.1 kb confers activation of the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3B). It was
reported previously that ERR cbinds to a consensus sequence
AGGTCA [38]. We aligned this sequence with the CREBH
promoter region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb and found a perfect match
to the consensus sequence, AGGTCA, spanning the 0.2 kb to
0.1 kb region. Transient transfection assays were performed using
wild-type and AGGTCA mutant CREBH promoters with the
ERR cexpression vector to test whether AGGTCA is critical for
ERR cbinding. This mutant reporter did not show any significant
response to ERR ccotransfection (Fig. 3C). Next, the ChIP assay
was performed to monitor the effect of Tm on ERR cand PGC1 a
recruitment to the endogenous CREBH gene promoter. Under
basal conditions, both ERR cand PGC1 aoccupied the CREBH
promoter. However, Tm treatment significantly augmented ERR c
and PGC1 aoccupancy on the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3D). The
ChIP assay results provide critical in vivo evidence that the ER-
stress-ERR c-PGC1 asignaling pathway increases CREBH gene
transcription. Gene activation is often associated with increased
histone acetylation [39], and the ChIP assay was performed to
determine whether Tm treatment results in increased template-
associated histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation of the CREBH
gene promoter in AML12 cells (Fig. 3E). Tm treatment and
adenoviral overexpression of ERR cand/or PGC1 aincreased
acetylation of H3 (Ac–H3) and H4 (Ac–H4) on the ERR c-
responsive region of the CREBH promoter, whereas knockdown
of endogenous ERR cor PGC1 asignificantly reduced histone (H3
and/or H4) acetylation. We observed a synergistic effect of ERR c
and PGC1 aoverexpression on acetylation of H3 (Ac–H3) and H4
(Ac–H4) (Fig. 3E) which was in accordance with our previous
results (Fig. 3A) where, synergistic effect on CREBH promoter
activation was clearly observed by cotransfection of ERR cand
PGC1 awith CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene.
Overall, these results demonstrate that ER stress augments the
binding of ERR cand PGC1 ato the CREBH promoter and
increases template-associated histone (H3 and H4) acetylation to
facilitate CREBH gene transcription.
Effect of ERR cKnockdown on CREBH-mediated
Regulation of CRP Gene Expression
Next, we examined regulation of CREBH target genes. Our
results (Figs. 1–3) demonstrate that ERR cregulates CREBH gene

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342expression in response to ER stress. CRP is a well-known marker
of various human diseases and is regulated by CREBH in responseto ER stress [11]. We examined the effect of ERR cknockdown on
Tm mediated CRP promoter activation by transient transfectionassay in 293T cells to verify the effect of ERR con CREBH target
gene (Fig. 4A). Both Tm treatment and ERR coverexpression
significantly increased CRP promoter activation. However,knockdown of endogenous ERR cor CREBH significantly blunted
the increase in CRP promoter activation by Tm. These resultsdemonstrate that Tm-induced CRP promoter activation ismediated through ERR c. Next, ERR cwas overexpressed in
AML12 cells to confirm the effect of ERR con CRP gene
expression (Fig. 4B). As expected, ERR coverexpression signifi-
cantly increased both CRP mRNA and protein levels, and thisincrease was significantly attenuated upon endogenous CREBHknockdown. This result indicates that ERR cregulates CRP gene
expression through CREBH. Endogenous ERR cwas knocked
down in AML12 cells for further verification. In agreement withthe previous results, we observed that the Tm-mediated increase inCRP mRNA and protein was substantially reduced after ERR c
knockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we demonstrated thatERR cinduces CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself.
Alcohol Feeding and Diabetic Obesity Induce Hepatic
CREBH and CRP Gene Expression via Hepatic ERR c
Our results (Figs. 1–4) demonstrate that ER stress induces
CREBH and CRP gene expression through ERR cin vitro .
GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERR c[4–8] that specifically
binds to ERR cand inhibits ERR ctranscriptional activity, was
used to verify this effect in vivo . As expected from previous results,
we noticed that GSK5182 treatment substantially reduced Tm-induced CREBH-N and CRP protein levels in mouse liver(Fig. 5A). Moreover, ERR cprotein levels were decreased upon
Tm+GSK treatment as compared to Tm alone. This might be due
to the mechanism of autoregulatory feed forward loop thatregulates ERR cgene expression [38]. Previous reports from our
laboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol consumption induceshepatic ERR cgene expression [8]. Mice were treated with EtOH
to investigate whether ERR cinduces CREBH-N and CRP gene
expression. The EtOH treatment significantly increased CREBH-N and CRP gene expression, along with ERR c. However,
GSK5182 strongly inhibited both basal and alcohol-inducedhepatic CREBH-N, and CRP protein expression in mice liver(Fig. 5B). Our laboratory reported previously that the diabeticobese condition ( db/db mice), induces ERR cgene expression [6].
A significant induction in CREBH-N and CRP protein levels wereobserved under the same conditions. However, we observed thatGSK5182 treatment substantially suppressed both CREBHN, andCRP protein levels in db/db mice liver in accordance with previous
results (Fig. 5C). Overall, we demonstrated that ERR cregulates
CREBH gene expression in vitro andin vivo .
Discussion
ER stress activates the unfolded protein response to generate
multiple transcription factors that function in different cellularphenomena including chromatin remodeling [40–44]. Our resultsprovide direct evidence for a newly recognized function of ERR c
during transcriptional regulation of CREBH in response to ERstress, as well as in diabetic obese condition [38,11]. Thecoactivator PGC1 aplays a crucial role in this regulation.
Moreover, chromatin remodeling during subsequent transcriptionevents was observed and provided a mechanistic basis for theERR c-mediated induction of CREBH under different physiolog-
ical conditions.
We reported previously that ERR cdirectly regulates ATF6 a,
an ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor, in response to
ER stress [38]. CREBH is also an ER membrane-bound bZIPtranscription factor that belongs to the same CREB3 family as
ATF6 a[11]. Moreover, we reported an increase in CREBH
mRNA level following ERR coverexpression, although not as
much as that of ATF6 a[38]. Hence, we investigated the role of
ERR cin the regulation of ER-bound transcription factor CREBH
under different physiological conditions including ER stress. We
observed significant enhancement of CREBH gene expression byoverexpressing ERR cin vitro and in vivo . A six-fold increase in
CREBH mRNA level was noticed along with a significant increase
in the CREBH-N form in response to ERR coverexpression
(Fig. 1). CREBH is regulated by nuclear receptor PPAR a,
HNF4 a, and GR [36–37,15]; hence, our current findings further
establish the interconnection between nuclear receptors and ER
membrane-bound transcription factors.
According to previous reports, ER stress activates both CREBH
and ERR cgene expression [11,38]. As we observed CREBH gene
induction by ERR c(Fig. 1), we speculated that ERR cmight be
involved in ER stressmediated induction of CREBH. In fact,
knockdown of endogenous ERR csignificantly reduced ER stress-
induced CREBH mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2), further
supporting the ER stress-ERR c-CREBH pathway. It has been
reported that ERR cactivates target genes by directly binding to
the ERRE on the promoter of the target gene [38]. This led us tospeculate the presence of ERRE on the CREBH promoter, and
we identified a potential site (AGGTCA) on the CREBH promoter
for ERR cbinding. The ChIP assay provided further crucial
evidence and confirmed ERR cbinding on the CREBH promoter
under ER stress. PGC1 ais closely associated with ERR c
transcriptional activity [3]. Several lines of evidence have shown
that the transcriptional regulation of PDK4 expression by PGC1 a
is mediated by ERR aor ERR c[45]. In accordance with these
previous reports, occupancy of PGC1 aon ERRE of the CREBH
promoter was observed during ER stress, providing critical in vivo
evidence indicating that PGC1 ais a coactivator for ERR c. Gene
repression is often associated with decreased histone acetylation
[39]. Chromatin remodeling also occurs during coactivator gene
transcription [46]. In agreement with previous reports, asignificant increase in template-associated histone, H3, and H4
acetylation was noticed (H3 and H4) at the ERRE on CREBH
promoter following Tm treatment or ERR coverexpression,
showing the importance of chromatin remodeling during gene
transcription (Fig. 3). Overall, our findings reveal a novel
molecular mechanism employed by ERR clinking transactivation
of ERR c[38] to CREBH gene expression. Along with past
indications of a probable nuclear receptor/ER membrane-bound
transcription factor interconnection, these data raise the possibility
(discussed further below) that ERR cmay serve as a key mediator
in ER stress-induced CREBH gene expression.
CRP, a known marker for several pathological conditions
including ER stress, is regulated by CREBH [11]. Besides being a
marker, CRP is an active mediator of endothelial dysfunction,arterial thrombosis, and atherogenesis [24–25]. Numerous groups
have shown pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of CRP
in vitro [25,47–48]. Transgenic expression of human CRP
suppresses endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and
bioactivity following vascular injury [49]. Several lines of evidence
suggest that CRP is a modulator that drives direct biological effects
on vascular cells. CRP, at concentrations known to predict adversevascular events, directly quenches the production of the NO, inRegulation of CREBH by ERR c
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342part, through a post-transcriptional effect on endothelial NO
synthase mRNA stability. Diminished NO bioactivity, in turn,
inhibits angiogenesis, an important compensatory mechanism
during chronic ischemia [50]. CRP has also been implicated in
glucose metabolism. CRP infusion induces an inflammatory
response followed by increased norepinephrine and cortisol levels,
which result in increased gluconeogenesis [51]. Our initial results
(Figs. 1–3) linking ER stress to ERR c-mediated induction of
CREBH, raise the possibility that ERR cmight regulate CREBH
target genes by regulating CREBH itself. ERR csignificantly
induced CRP gene expression (Fig. 4), which further verifies the
ER stress-ERR c-CREBH pathway. Alcohol consumption induces
hepatic ERR cexpression [8]. ERR cgene expression increases in
the liver of db/db mice [6]. Moreover, ERR calong with CREBH
are positive regulators of gluconeogenesis [6,15]. In agreement
with these previous reports, alcohol treatment significantly induced
both CREBH and CRP gene expression, and this augmentation
was substantially compromised upon ERR cinhibition in vivo
(Fig. 5B). Regulation of CREBH by ERR cwas further established
when GSK5182 treatment significantly reduced CREBH and its
target gene, CRP, expression in db/db mice liver tissue (Fig. 5C).
ERR c, CREBH, and CRP are implicated in numerous
biological events. ERR cregulates hepatic gluconeogenesis [6]
and hepatic lipid metabolism [7]. CREBH positively regulates
hepatic gluconeogenesis [15]. In addition, CREBH is a master
regulator of the lipin 1 gene, a key regulator of lipid metabolism
[17]. Both CREBH and ERR cgene expression is enhanced in adiabetic mouse model to increase blood glucose level [15,6].
Regulation of both factors is important to regulate gluconeogenesisin response to ER stress, and diabetes. Because the regulation ofCRP is also very critical to maintain glucose homeostasis as well asother cellular phenomena including angiogenesis, inhibitingCREBH transactivity and CRP gene expression by inhibitingERR cthrough GSK5182 could be important to relieve disease
symptoms. As depicted in Fig. 5D, we hypothesize that ERR c
directly binds to the CREBH promoter along with coactivatorPGC1 ato regulate CREBH at the transcriptional level in response
to ER stress and other physiological conditions, and that CREBH,in turn, regulates its target genes. Overall, our current findingsprovide insight into a novel chromatin remodeling strategy utilizedby ERR c, and it may be helpful to understand the complex link
between nuclear receptors, ER membrane-bound transcriptionfactors, and glucose homeostasis.
